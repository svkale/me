					Pune, Maharashtra, India from my childhood. I live with my mother, father, my grandfather and my sister.
				</p>
				<p>
					As I live in Pune, my mother tongue is Marathi. I did my primary and secondary education from the local schools, named 'Vishwakarma Vidyalaya' and 'Ashok Vidyalaya' respectively. I took my tutions for JEE in Pune itself. After cracking JEE-Advanced, now I am pursuing BTech in Mechanical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Indore.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though, I have opted for degree in mechanical engineering, I am always eager for acquiring core knowledge in other fields, like electrical, management and Information Technology.
				</p>
				<p>
					I love singing, playing sitar, harmonium and tabla. I love listening to indian classical music, and I can spend hours listening to it.

				<h2>Music in my life</h2>
				<p>
					I have been fond of music since my childhood. My father plays flute. He taught me to play our <em>National Anthem</em> on harmonium when I was in First grade. I played it on stage in my school on the occasion of 'Independence Day'. My musical journey started from there. Then, my mother asked me to join a class to learn how to play tabla when I was 10. I was not at all interested at that time. My father, in spite of knowing the scenario, told me not to leave it and continue learning. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2015, when a Marathi movie remake of an old musical drama, <cite>Katyar Kaljat Ghusali (कट्यार काळजात घुसली )</cite> released, I was so amazed by listening such masterpieces, that I started learning all about Indian classical music. I started singing and playing tabla with a lot more enthusiasm. I think that, the first time I watched the movie, was the turning point of my musical life.
				</p>
				<p>
					After passing 10th Grade, I started learning sitar from Mr. Deepak Desai, who is a disciple of Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan, who learnt to play sitar, according to Indian <i>Guru - Shishya Parampara</i>. He is very happy with my skills in playing with rhythm; thanks to my father, who always encouraged me to continue tabla.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here is a video of me, playing sitar, raga Des.
